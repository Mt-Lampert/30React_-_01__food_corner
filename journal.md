I prepared everything for the project:

1. vite-react
0. vitest
0. @testing-library/react, @testing-library/jsdom

Writing my first test, I ran into a surprise. Vitest requires test files to end with `.jsx` if the test is about a React component with JSX included. After getting that right, everything went smoothly. Thank God!
